Hello this Ashley, and I created this repo and markdown document. 

Collaborator(Kaitlyn)
Lets make some histograms!
```{r}

library(tidyverse)
kermit<- read_csv("kermit.csv")

kermit_hist<- ggplot(kermit, aes(x= Score.pre))+
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~Gender)

kermit_hist
  
```

Creator: doing some rank-based tests

```{r}

# is there a significant difference in pre-talks kermit scores for males and females?

# unpaired data: Mann-Whitney U
# look at pre as a function of gender,  result is, cannot compute p value with ties, that is just saying...?

MwU_kermit <- kermit %>% 
  wilcox.test(Score.pre ~ Gender, data = .)

MwU_kermit

```
